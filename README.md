The application is designed to facilitate audience interaction during lectures, conferences, and similar events.

- Lecturers can create their own courses, which other users can join. They have the option of customizing the background image.
- The platform includes an instant chat messaging app that can be used during the course.
- Users have the option to register, log in (if already registered), or join a course anonymously.
- There is an admin site that allows for the maintenance of the user and course database, as well as the chat features.
- The backend is built using Node.js and EJS is used to generate HTML files on the client-side.
